Create an ApartmentException class whose constructor receives a 
String that holds a street address, an apartment number, a number of bedrooms, 
and a rent value for an apartment. Save the file as ApartmentException.java. 

Create an Apartment class with those fields. The Apartment constructor requires 
values for each field. Upon construction, throw an ApartmentException if the apartment
number does not consist of three digits, 
if the number of bedrooms is less than 1 or more than 4, or if the 
rent is less than $500 or over $2,500. Save the class as Apartment.java. 

Write an application that establishes an array of at least six Apartment objects 
with valid and invalid values. Display an appropriate message when an Apartment object 
is created successfully and when one is not. Save the file as ThrowApartmentException.java.
